Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/cryptogrampus/terraform-provider-grafana`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-grafana
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cryptogrampus/terraform-provider-grafana
$ make build
```

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make bin
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-grafana
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`. This should be
performed before merging or opening pull requests.

```sh
$ GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000 GRAFANA_AUTH=admin:admin make testacc
```

This requires a running Grafana server locally. This provider targets
the latest version of Grafana, but older versions should be compatible where
possible. In some cases, older versions of this provider will work with
older versions of Grafana.

If you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed, you can
run Grafana with the following command:

```sh
$ make test-serv
```

By default, this will use the latest version of Grafana based on their
Docker repository. You can specify the version with the following:

```sh
$ GRAFANA_VERSION=3.1.1 make test-serv
```

This command will run attached and will stop the Grafana server when
interrupted. Images will be cached locally by Docker so it is quicky to
restart the server as necessary. The server will use the default port and
credentials for the `GRAFANA_AUTH` and `GRAFANA_URL` environment variables.

Nightly acceptance tests are run against the `latest` tag of the Grafana
maintained Docker image.
